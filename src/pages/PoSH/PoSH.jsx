                </p>

                <h3 className="posh-subtitle">1. Sexual Harassment</h3>
                <p>
                    Sexual harassment may occur not only where a person uses sexual behavior to control, influence or affect the career, salary or job of another person, but also between co-workers. It may also occur between a ClickMecha employee and someone that employee deals with in the course of work who is not employed by ClickMecha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sexual Harassment” includes any one or more of the following unwelcome acts or behavior (whether directly or by implication):

                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>b) The following circumstances, if linked to such behavior sexually determined acts, also amount to sexual harassment:</strong>
                </p>
